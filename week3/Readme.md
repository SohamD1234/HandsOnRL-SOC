For Week 3, we will be looking at two classes of algorithms to deal with prediction and control problems, when we don't know the model of the environment :
1: Monte Carlo Methods
2: Temporal Difference Learning
The primary reading material for this week will be Chapters 5 and 6 of Grokking DRL. Also, if you are interested in a more theoretical approach, you may also refer to chapters 5 and 6 from Sutton and Barto and additionally chapter 7 for Eligibility Traces, which acts as a bridge between these two classes of algorithms.
