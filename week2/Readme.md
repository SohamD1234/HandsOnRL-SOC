# week2
Our learning objectives for this week are:
1. N-armed bandits: Perhaps the simplest RL challenge. You are provided with n arms, and you can pull one of them at a time. Each arm gives a reward from a probability distribution, independent of which arms you pulled beforehand (However it may depend on the time step you pull). Your task is to maximize the sum of these rewards, that is essentially find the arm which gives the maximum expected reward. We will be studying few algorithms to solve this problem.
2. Formalism of Reinforcement Learning in terms of Markov Decision Process: Way to generalise and represent a given problem as a Reinforcement Learning problem.
3. Dynamic Programming: The most basic set of algorithms to deal with prediction and control problems, that is, finding an optimal policy given the complete Markov DecisionÂ Process
